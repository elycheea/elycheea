### Hello 👋

I’m Elysia — a creative technologist.

By day, I’m a senior product designer and the front-end lead for an internal product on IBM’s intranet.<br/>
By night, I’m an intensely casual gamer, enjoying island life as I slowly pay back my debts to Tom Nook. #ACNH

Working closely with both designers and developers, I’ve have a growing interest in design and front-end dev ops.

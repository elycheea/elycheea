### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Elysia â€” a creative technologist.

By day, Iâ€™m a senior product designer and the front-end lead for an internal product on IBMâ€™s intranet.<br/>
By night, Iâ€™m an intensely casual gamer, enjoying island life as I slowly pay back my debts to Tom Nook. #ACNH

Working closely with both designers and developers, Iâ€™ve have a growing interest in design ops and front-end dev ops.
